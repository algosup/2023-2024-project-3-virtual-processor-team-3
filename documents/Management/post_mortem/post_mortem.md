# Document Overview

This document was made once the project was concluded, it goes down into what every team member felt glad, sad, and made about during the project. It's made to define the point on which we all should be working to improve for future projects.

## Mad, Sad, Glad

| Member   | Mad                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Sad                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Glad                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| Thibaud  | Presentation which didn't go as expected. <br> Not being confident enough.                                                                                                                                                                          | Could have done way better during the project. Didn't go out of his comfort zone.                                                                                                                     | Did recover well during the presentation mishap. <br> Developed a lot personally during the project, and felt great throughout it. And learned a lot. <br> Glad about the team, felt like having a good team. <br> Glad about the project overall and himself.                                                                                                                       |
| Quentin  | A single change screwed the presentation. <br> Functional being noted in the middle of the project discouraged Quentin, it is a document that evolves. He felt mad about being noted on a document which isn't in his final form. <br> | Lack of communication within the team.                                                                                                                                                                  | Great teamwork among the team members, everyone was helping each other out. <br> His document felt meaningful while writing it. It was the first time he felt as if he had a great understanding of the project.                                                                                                                                                               |
| Aurélien | Wasn't aware enough about his role. <br> Felt like he should have helped Mathis way more with the development. <br> The lack of communication adds to this. <br> He felt like he didn't push himself enough.                                          | The presentation, didn't go as expected. Even if we had rehearsed a lot, the change in material right before the presentation screwed it.                                                         | Glad about the jury's reaction when releasing the Visual Studio Extension. It made him proud to succeed in conveying the message we wanted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Mathis   | Couldn't go over a task until he had finished it (Scope creep) which led him to lose time. <br> Lack of communication, which led the team to twice the same task, leading to a loss of time.                                                        | Subsequently, Mathis was sad about the facts that had previously been put in "mad".                                                                                                                  | Glad about his code and the project overall. <br> He felt like he had learned a lot during this project, he felt a curve rising. <br> Happy to have learned the C programming language. <br> Achieved the goal we had set (educational project). <br> Having an ambitious goal that we have fulfilled made him particularly glad about the team, himself, and the project. |
| Malo     | Malo wasn't particularly mad about anything.                                                                                                                                                                                                          | He was sad about himself, as he knows he could have been faster during the development phase. This time lost could've been invested into helping Mathis out and adding more features to the final product. | Glad about the whole project, he felt like it was all flowing smoothly, as expected. He had a great time during the project. He's proud of himself even if he knows he can still improve.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Arthur   | Not mad about anything, except for the fact that the coding and naming conventions were changed in the middle of the project, which led to several issues.                                                                                     | He felt as if he could have (and should have) done way more during this project.                                                                                                                        | Glad about the final product.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| Thibaud  | Go out of his comfort more frequently. <br> Should obtrude more as a project manager. <br>  Be more aware of his surroundings. <br> Be confident.                                             | Procrastinate. <br> Rely too much on others <br>  Putting blame on himself.                                                                       | Keep doing as much as he can, Quentin described Thibaud as a "Swiss army knife". <br>  Not being too authoritarian.                                                                                                                                                              |
| Quentin  | Go deeper into the Software Engineers once done with the functional specifications. <br> Communicate more with the team members.                                                              | Stop being too timid to bother others.                                                                                                            | Helping each other out when needed and being open to giving a hand to other team members. <br> Being ambitious.<br> Big brainstorming at the beginning of the project, as it gives a better understanding and overview of the project.                                          |
| Aurélien | Articulate more while communicating. As sometimes it was hard to understand what he was saying.                                                                                               | Procrastinate. <br> Change the naming and convention in the middle of the project. This should be set right away and remain untouched afterward. | Forcing members to follow convention. Made them well respected and provided a sheer GitHub repository. <br> Having a great overview of the code development.                                                                                                               |

| Mathis   | More daily meetings, of 5-10 mins to improve communication. <br> Synchronize knowledge among the team members, as some members were left behind, while Mathis was digging deeper and deeper.  | Being a scope creep. <br> Should stop breaking down the project all by himself.                                                                   | Highly ambitious. <br> Keep this habit of researching a lot of things related to the project. It helps to have a better understanding of the technology and the project.  <br> Putting down everything that he thinks of and created, helps in visualizing and understanding.  |
| Arthur   | Being more involved in the team and the project.                                                                                                                                            | Procrastinate                                                                                                                                     | Bring happiness into the team, which leads to having a great ambiance overall.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
