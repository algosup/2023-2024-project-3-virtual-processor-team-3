## 1.1 Introduction

This document describes our plan of action to improve the quality of communication:

- Within the team,
- With the client,
- With the public,
- And any other sources that would be interested in our project
  
This document will set the guidelines, the frequency, and everything that is needed to have great communication among all the stakeholders. This document will improve the team's quality if the guidelines are respected. Communication means a broader product as the overall quality of the final product will be elevated to a higher state.
This document serves to help in the identification of the client's needs and expectations as communicating with the client is necessary to ensure that both parties are aiming the same way.
In a nutshell, this document is made for every stakeholder, to ensure a high-quality product by the end of the project.

| Frequency                  | Three times a week                            | Three times a week                                    | Three times a week                                    | Three times a week                     | Three times a week                  | Twice a week                                          |

Note: \
Frequency: The basis on which, a member communicates with others to either, ask about progress, communicate with others about their progress, or inquire for information about a document, etc. \
This frequency varies from week to week according to members' schedules. \
In this table, frequency represents an average.

**Weekly Meetings**:

Our team, is hosting bi-weekly meetings. According to the week's schedule, the team gather for a 20 minutes meeting the first time that they are working together in a week. And the last day in which they meet in project. \
This bi-weekly planning has been acted since the beginning of the project. They are made to discuss the current state of the project. Discuss the progress of the project (which then fuels KPIs), discuss ideas, discuss the current feeling amongst the team about the final product and about overall members' feeling and emotions. \
This is a way for the team to ensure that everything is running as expected and as smooth as possible, all while ensuring the team's well-being and the project's.

### 1.2.2 With the stakeholders

Refer to the Project Charter of this project, where stakeholders have been defined: [Project Charter Here](https://github.com/algosup/2023-2024-project-3-virtual-processor-team-3/blob/main/documents/Management/project_charter/project_charter.md)

Communication between the different stakeholders, is handled by the program manager and the Project Manager. \
They both engage in:

- Ensuring that the client's requirement are well understood
- Providing a weekly feedback to the client
- Ensuring that the client is aware of the project's progress
- Ensuring a great communication from within the team.

Currently, our team is posting weekly reports every week, which are available to the stakeholders. \
Moreover, we reserve right to allow the stakeholder to ask for a meeting if it seems necessary for the project's weel-being.

Communication between our team and the client is handled via Email communication in the formal form.
Moreover, communications between other stakeholders is handled mostly via the Slack Software.

### 1.2.3 Current Outcome

From the last meeting between the team members, some issues have been marked. The team feels like there's not enough communication between each other, mostly between the project manager and other members. Moreover, we feel like we could communicate with the stakeholders even more.

There's a desire from the team to improve the overall communication within the team and a desire to inform more the client about the project's state in order to get feedback and to ensure that everything is going in the wanted direction. \
Current communication with the client via email, were resourceful and were answering some of our questions. However, we still felt like some fields were still foggy and this is probably due to the way we wrote to the client. We didn't made sure that we were asking everything we were eager to hear about

The outcome of this document is to improve the quality of the communication to meet the expectations of both the team and the client. The communication planning process will help the team to understand, when, how and to whom communicate and thus in a more effective way but as well for the client to understand how to contact us and how so in an effective way.

## 3. Objectives

### 3.1 Communication Objectives

In order to improve the current communication state, actions must be taken, here are the three main decision that have been taken.

1. Greater communication from Project manager to the team members:

- The project manager, engages to take more part into discussions to communicate more effectively with every team members. \
In order to do so, the project manager will ask for daily feedback to have a better insight of the current progress being made on the project. This will greatly help in term of project planning, in communication among the team. Reduce various threats such as broken communication and team disengagement.
