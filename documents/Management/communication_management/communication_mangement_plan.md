## 1.1 Introduction

This document describes our plan of action to improve the quality of communication:

- Within the team,
- With the client,
- With the public,
- And any other sources that would be interested in our project
  
This document will set the guidelines, the frequency, and everything that is needed to have great communication among all the stakeholders. This document will improve the team's quality if the guidelines are respected. Communication means a broader product as the overall quality of the final product will be elevated to a higher state.
This document serves to help in the identification of the client's needs and expectations as communicating with the client is necessary to ensure that both parties are aiming the same way.
In a nutshell, this document is made for every stakeholder, to ensure a high-quality product by the end of the project.

## 1.2 Current Communication Activities

### 1.2.1 Amongst the team

This table describes the current communication activities made within the team.

| Sends information to       | Whole Team                        | Technical Leader, Project Manager                     | Software Engineers, Project Manager, Program Manager. | Technical Leader, Project Manager      | Technical Leader, Project Manager   | Software Engineers, Technical Leader                  |
| Receives information from  | Whole Team                        | Project Manager, Technical Leader, Software Engineers | Project Manager, Program Manager, Software Engineers  | Technical Leader, Project Manager      | Technical Leader, Project Manager   | Project Manager, Software Engineers, Technical Leader |
| Frequency                  | Three times a week                            | Three times a week                                    | Three times a week                                    | Three times a week                     | Three times a week                  | Twice a week                                          |

Note: \
Frequency: The basis on which, a member communicates with others to either, ask about progress, communicate with others about their progress, or inquire for information about a document, etc. \
This frequency varies from week to week according to members' schedules. \
In this table, frequency represents an average.

**Weekly Meetings**:

Our team, is hosting bi-weekly meetings. According to the week's schedule, the team gather for a 20 minutes meeting the first time that they are working together in a week. And the last day in which they meet in project. \
This bi-weekly planning has been acted since the beginning of the project. They are made to discuss the current state of the project. Discuss the progress of the project (which then fuels KPIs), discuss ideas, discuss the current feeling amongst the team about the final product and about overall members' feeling and emotions. \
This is a way for the team to ensure that everything is running as expected and as smooth as possible, all while ensuring the team's well-being and the project's.

### 1.2.2 With the stakeholders

Refer to the Project Charter of this project, where stakeholders have been defined: [Project Charter Here](https://github.com/algosup/2023-2024-project-3-virtual-processor-team-3/blob/main/documents/Management/project_charter/project_charter.md)

Communication between the different stakeholders, is handled by the program manager and the Project Manager. \
They both engage in:

- Ensuring that the client's requirement are well understood
- Providing a weekly feedback to the client
- Ensuring that the client is aware of the project's progress
- Ensuring a great communication from within the team.

Currently, our team is posting weekly reports every week, which are available to the stakeholders. \
Moreover, we reserve right to allow the stakeholder to ask for a meeting if it seems necessary for the project's weel-being.

Communication between our team and the client is handled via Email communication in the formal form.
Moreover, communications between other stakeholders is handled mostly via the Slack Software.

### 1.2.3 Current Outcome

From the last meeting between the team members, some issues have been marked. The team feels like there's not enough communication between each other, mostly between the project manager and other members. Moreover, we feel like we could communicate with the stakeholders even more.

There's a desire from the team to improve the overall communication within the team and a desire to inform more the client about the project's state in order to get feedback and to ensure that everything is going in the wanted direction. \
Current communication with the client via email, were resourceful and were answering some of our questions. However, we still felt like some fields were still foggy and this is probably due to the way we wrote to the client. We didn't made sure that we were asking everything we were eager to hear about

The outcome of this document is to improve the quality of the communication to meet the expectations of both the team and the client. The communication planning process will help the team to understand, when, how and to whom communicate and thus in a more effective way but as well for the client to understand how to contact us and how so in an effective way.

## 3. Objectives

### 3.1 Communication Objectives

In order to improve the current communication state, actions must be taken, here are the three main decision that have been taken.

1. Greater communication from Project manager to the team members:

- The project manager, engages to take more part into discussions to communicate more effectively with every team members. \
In order to do so, the project manager will ask for daily feedback to have a better insight of the current progress being made on the project. This will greatly help in term of project planning, in communication among the team. Reduce various threats such as broken communication and team disengagement.  

2. Greater communication between our team and the client:

- Our team engages to use every possible ways (which will be described later) to communicate effectively and regularly with the client. Our team will send all necessary information that needs the attention of the client.

3. Creation of Guidelines to follow for communication:

- Creation of guidelines to follow while communicating among the stakeholders is necessary and will be set among our team. A formal message needs to follow guidelines in order to be receivable by the client. Mutual respect is necessary and is the key to a great communication.

### 3.2 Communication Guidelines

General guidelines:

- Every communication will be made in a formal way
- Our communication team will communicate once and only when the whole team has accepted to do so.
- Reporting is unbiased

#### 3.2.1 Communication with the client

Messages are audience-specific, communication with the client will only be things that concerning the client, this could be:

- Documents created by the team for the project such as:
  - Functional Specifications
  - Technical Specifications
  - Project Charter
- Inquiry about the project
- Deliverables
- Weekly Reports
- KPIs

Moreover, these documents have to be written in a formal way, any other use of language will not be tolerated during approval of the document. We must thoroughly check the language used when writting a document. These documents will be posted on our GitHub repository.

Every communication with the client, will be handled via email.
Emails are a formal communication form. They must be concise, tailored to the client's knowledge, as clear as possible. \
These are a way to ensure that what we inquire is understood by the client, in order to have the best answer possible, that responds to every inquiry and in an effective way.

These documents are written principaly for the client, to inform himself about the project's progress. The client can take action from the documents he gets, and can express his worries about specific things, if needed. But as well for us to get feedback from our progress and to ensure that we meet the client's expectation by the end of the project.

#### 3.2.2 Communication with the public

Our work is available to the public on our GitHub repository, meaning that we must keep a formal language at all time, whenever we are posting or communicating on the repository.

Moreover, if we ever are contacted about the project by the public, this will take place via email. The same rules as when communicating with the client will apply when being in contact with the public.

In addition, if the public contact us about inquiries, it means that your work either lacks documentation or clarity. \
We will try to communicate on what people need to know, before they even know it. Meaning that strong documentation is necessary and must be as clear as possible and tailored to a wide audience, even to the most unknowledgable ones.

We are still open to public inquiries if necessary on specific topics, such as legal concerns, safety concerns, etc. \
 Communication will be handled by the Project Manager in this case

#### 3.2.3 Communication among the team

### 4. Stakeholders

#### 4.1 Target Audience

<!--
4 Stakeholders

So far, you have described the communications environment and set 3 key objectives for communications within your team. The next step is to identify who it is that will be involved in the dissemination and receipt of communications issued by your team i.e. who is going to create, send out and receive the formal communications messages.

4.1 Target Audience
List and describe each of the audience groups (i.e. stakeholders) that your team will communicate with. Remember that this is a formal Communications Plan. Therefore, you with only wish to list audience groups whom your team will want to communicate formally with. 

For example, a project may have the following target audiences:

    • Project board (sponsor, director, other board members)
    • Project management team (project manager, project leaders)
    • Project team members
    • Related project teams
    • Project management office
    • Related business unit managers
    • Internal audit or strategy staff
    • External suppliers and contractors
    • Governance and regulatory bodies

4.2 Stakeholder Requirements
You now know exactly who it is that you are going to formally communicate with. The next step is to identify the information that they need to receive. List each stakeholder in the table below then describe the information that they need to receive and the timeframe in which they need to receive it.  -->
