# 1. Overview

## 1.1 Introduction

This document describes our plan of action to improve the quality of communication:

1. Within the team,
2. With the client,
3. With the public,
4. And any other sources that would be interested in our project

This document will set the guidelines, the frequency and everything which is needed to have a great communication amongst all the stakeholders. This document will greatly improve the team's quality if the guidelines are respected. A great communication means a broader product as the overall quality of the final product will be elevated to an higher state. \
This document serves to help in the identification of the client's needs and expectations as communicating with the client is necessary to ensure that both parties are aiming the same way. \
In a nutshell, this document is made for every stakeholders, to ensure a high quality product by the end of the project.

| Frequency                  | three times a week                            | three times a week                                    | three times a week                                    | three times a week                     | three times a week                  | Twice a week                                          |

Note: \
Frequency: The basis on which, a member communicate with other to either, ask about progress, communicate with others about their own progress, ask information about a document... This frequency varies from week to week according to members' schedule. \
In this table, frequency represents an average.

**Weekly Meetings**:

Our team, is hosting bi-weekly meetings. According to the week's schedule, the team gather for a 20 minutes meeting the first time that they are working together in a week. And the last day in which they meet in project. \
This bi-weekly planning has been acted since the beginning of the project. They are made to discuss the current state of the project. Discuss the progress of the project (which then fuels KPIs), discuss ideas, discuss the current feeling amongst the team about the final product and about overall members' feeling and emotions. \
This is a way for the team to ensure that everything is running as expected and as smooth as possible, all while ensuring the team's well-being and the project's.

### 1.2.2 With the stakeholders

Refer to the Project Charter of this project, where stakeholders have been defined: [Project Charter Here](https://github.com/algosup/2023-2024-project-3-virtual-processor-team-3/blob/main/documents/Management/project_charter/project_charter.md)

Communication between the different stakeholders, is handled by the program manager and the Project Manager. \
They both engage in:

- Ensuring that the client's requirement are well understood
- Providing a weekly feedback to the client
- Ensuring that the client is aware of the project's progress
- Ensuring a great communication from within the team.

Currently, our team is posting weekly reports every week, which are available to the stakeholders. \
Moreover, we reserve right to allow the stakeholder to ask for a meeting if it seems necessary for the project's weel-being.

Communication between our team and the client is handled via Email communication in the formal form.
Moreover, communications between other stakeholders is handled mostly via the Slack Software.

### 1.2.3 Current Outcome

From the last meeting between the team members, some issues have been marked. The team feels like there's not enough communication between each other, mostly between the project manager and other members. Moreover, we feel like we could communicate with the stakeholders even more. \

There's a desire from the team to improve the overall communication within the team and a desire to inform more the client about the project's state in order to get feedback and to ensure that everything is going in the wanted direction. \
Current communication with the client via email, were resourceful and were answering some of our questions. However, we still felt like some fields were still foggy and this is probably due to the way we wrote to the client. We didn't made sure that we were asking everything we were eager to hear about

The outcome of this document is to improve the quality of the communication to meet the expectations of both the team and the client. The communication planning process will help the team to understand, when, how and to whom communicate and thus in a more effective way but as well for the client to understand how to contact us and how so in an effective way.

## 2. Environment Situation Analysis

This part analyzes the current strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of the previously defined environmnent to determine in a near future the action to take to improve the communication plan.

### 2.1 Strengths

### 2.2 Weaknesses

### 2.3 Opportunities

### 2.4 Threats

<!-- II. Now that you have set out the basis for creating the Communications Plan, the next step is to perform a “Situation Analysis” by describing the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats that exist in your communications environment. For instance:

    • Strengths: Your team may be particularly good at identifying the type of information that people need to receive and the timeframe in which it should be delivered.
    • Weaknesses: But your team may for instance need to improve the frequency that the information is distributed or make the information more selective to the target audience.
    • Opportunities: There may be opportunities for improving project awareness, company profile or public knowledge. You may also be able to build support for your project activities; help gain funding or boost productivity.
    • Threats: Threats which may exist can include; messages not being interpreted as expected, changes to your team culture depending on how they are portrayed or other departments not reacting positively to the communications sent out. 

It is important that you clearly identify all strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats, so that you can gain a complete picture of the environment in which you are about to issue formal communications. 

2.3 Lessons Learned
Now that you have described the environment within which formal communications are made, the next step is to describe the current status of communications within your team:

    • List the generic communications activities which have taken place to date
    • Describe how those communications were made and the key messages portrayed
    • Identify the level of success of those messages
    • Document any lessons learned

By describing how prior communications were undertaken by your project / team and any lessons learned, you can further “set the scene” for the communications activities that are needed to keep the right stakeholders informed, with the right information, at the right time.

3 Objectives
So far, you have set out the current state of communications within your team. The next step is to describe the future state, which will be achieved through the execution of this plan.
3.1 Communications Objectives
List here, the top 3 objectives that are to be achieved by the execution of this Communications Plan. Try and make your objectives: Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant and Timely (S.M.A.R.T) where possible. For instance, your objectives may be related to:
    • Increasing stakeholder awareness
    • Improving team efficiency and productivity
    • Gaining management sponsorship and buy-in
    • Changing the perception of your team
    • Improving team culture and behaviour.

    3.2 Communications Guidelines
To help you meet your objectives, list all of the guidelines that are applicable to the dissemination of communications messages within your team. For instance, your communications guidelines might be that:
    • All messages will be audience-specific
    • Every key message will be communicated formally
    • Messages will be distributed through an appropriate channel
    • The team will communicate what people need to know before they need to know it
    • Communication will be tailored, based on what people need to know
    • All critical communications must be approved by management prior to distribution
    • Only the communications team will be able to distribute official press releases
    • Project-wide meetings will be held at all important milestones
    • Regular, unbiased reporting will be undertaken
    • The project team will listen and act on feedback

4 Stakeholders

So far, you have described the communications environment and set 3 key objectives for communications within your team. The next step is to identify who it is that will be involved in the dissemination and receipt of communications issued by your team i.e. who is going to create, send out and receive the formal communications messages.

4.1 Target Audience
List and describe each of the audience groups (i.e. stakeholders) that your team will communicate with. Remember that this is a formal Communications Plan. Therefore, you with only wish to list audience groups whom your team will want to communicate formally with. 

For example, a project may have the following target audiences:

    • Project board (sponsor, director, other board members)
    • Project management team (project manager, project leaders)
    • Project team members
    • Related project teams
    • Project management office
    • Related business unit managers
    • Internal audit or strategy staff
    • External suppliers and contractors
    • Governance and regulatory bodies
4.2 Stakeholder Requirements
You now know exactly who it is that you are going to formally communicate with. The next step is to identify the information that they need to receive. List each stakeholder in the table below then describe the information that they need to receive and the timeframe in which they need to receive it.  -->
