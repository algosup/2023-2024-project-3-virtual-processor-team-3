# Project Virtual Processor - Team 3  

## Weekly Report N°5

### <u> Introduction </u>

This week marks the 5th week of the virtual processor project. However, this week was cut short as only 3h30 was specified during school hours for the week.
We've been focusing on another project that was given to us in Git class.

### <u>Team meeting</u>

The team gathered on Monday the 5th of January and was the only time in the week that they gathered to discuss the project's progress. We've only dispatched basic tasks. We knew that the week would be short project-wise. However, some progress needed to be made to improve the final product. So the week was made to read documentation for ourselves on how we would build the debugger. We're still needing to define all the major steps to create it. \
Moreover, we've received the functional specification feedback from the reviewers and analyzed it. We've found many points to modify and to go deeper into to improve the document and the final product's quality.

### <u>Week feedback</u>

As previously said, the week was quite short, our team was focused on the Git courses. Little to no progress was made on the product, but this week was necessary for the team and was resourceful. More progress will be made next week and hopefully, we will nearly finish the processor and the assembly. Then we will focus on the debugger and the Visual Studio code plugin.

### <u>Next week planning </u>

- Finalize the Test Plan
- Submit the Test plan to the client and the reviewers
- Start the debugger development
- Continue to read the documentation
- Create a PDF on which our documentation will be
- Improve the KPIs
- Start working on the plugin if possible.
