### <u>Team meeting</u>

The team first gathered on Monday the 12th of February 2024. After briefly discussing the various progress made during the weekend, the team quickly got back to work on the various tasks that were dispatched. We agreed to start to create the Assembly documentation during the week. Moreover, the development team started to implement various features.
On Friday the 16th, no meeting was "held" as we had to release the Test Plan, however, during the afternoon, we still had small talks about the week and the next few weeks.

### <u>Week feedback</u>

The team is positive about the progress of the project and we expect to respect deadlines. However, we're finding out that some nice-to-have features we would have liked to add to our product will most likely be present in the final product, as we are starting to get low on available hours. Moreover, we will need to prepare the oral presentation which will occupy most of our time during the coming weeks.
We will most likely check all the requirements, but we will most likely not be able to have a fully working product, with nice-to-have features.

### <u>Next week planning </u>

For a more detailed breakdown, please refer to the Gant chart: [Link](https://github.com/users/Biohazardyee/projects/2/views/2))

- Near the finalization of the processor and the assembly
- Try to have a small working debugger
- Start working on the oral presentation
- Quality check the whole product
- Finalize the assembly documentation
