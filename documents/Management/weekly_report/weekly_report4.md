# Project Virtual Processor - Team 3  

## Weekly Report N°4

### <u>Introduction </u>

This week marks the fourth week of the Virtual Processor Project. One major event happened this week: we had to submit and send the [functional specifications](https://github.com/algosup/2023-2024-project-3-virtual-processor-team-3/blob/main/documents/functional_specifications.md) to the client. \
However, there was no time to rest as the technical specifications document is due next week. \
Moreover, we need to keep progressing on the overall state of the project. \
This document will show the weekly progress made on the project, on various tasks and shows the tasks done during the week.

### <u>Team meeting</u>

The first weekly meeting was held on Monday the 29th of January. \
Firstly, we discussed the various progress that were made during the weekend to plan the week according to what we needed to do. \
We agreed on focusing on the Functional Specifications as the document was due the next day and much work still needed, at the time, to be done on the document. \
Moreover, the team mentioned that the Project Manager was not enough integrated into the technical discussions, and this had to be taken into consideration. \
We then dispatched various tasks for the day and started to work. \

The second weekly meeting was held on Friday the second of February.

### <u>Week feedback</u>

This week, we had 21 project hours available to us, Monday and Tuesday were ruled by finalizing the functional requirements document, its review, and its submission. The team was delighted to conclude this document, it was a relief. \
However, we noticed that the document still needed some changes, which were done, later. \
Moreover, the technical specifications document is done and awaiting review. The document will undergo many modifications still but most of the job is done. \
From the meetings we held and personal feedback, the team would like the Project Manager to be more of a part of the discussions that are held about the technical part of the project. In this dynamic of change, the [Communication Management Plan Document](https://github.com/algosup/2023-2024-project-3-virtual-processor-team-3/blob/main/documents/Management/weekly_report/weekly_report3.md) was created, to improve the communication from within the team but also reflect exterior sources. \
This week was exhaustive, the team needs to rest during the weekend. Our team will come back, energetic, on Monday.
