# Project Virtual Processor - Team 3  

## Weekly Report N°2

### <u> Introduction </u>

This week was once more ruled by learning the C language which is necessary for this project, however, we have had the time to gather during project time to discuss various directions that we will take for the project.

### <u>Team meeting</u>

The 17th of January 2024, we gathered for the first during project time to have a meeting about various directions to take, during the morning we had:

- Discussed the specifications of our Assembly Language,
- Broke down the different steps to build our own Virtual Processor,
- Started working on the Processor's architecture by checking different architectures that already exist,
- Decided to take inspiration from different CPUs, RISK-V, ARM...
- Set up our coding environment and laws of development.

- We have decided to contact the client about the various decisions that we have taken and the client seemed interested in the directions we were taking.

### <u>Week feedback</u>

This week didn't mark any great advancement document writing-wise, but gathering to take all these decisions was necessary. We are sure to all have the same scope for the project. We still have yet to decide on all the specifications for the project, but this will be done shortly.

### <u>Next week planning </u>

- Initial meeting on Monday the 22nd
- Functional specification near finalization
- Functional specification review, if finished
- Project Charter publishing
- Advancing on Technical specifications (25% of completion)
- Advancing on Test plan (20% completion)
- Discuss the last details
- Beginning of vCPU development
