### <u>Team meeting</u>

Our first team meeting was held on the 10th of January 2024.  
During this meeting, we agreed on holding at least two weekly meetings according to our project time. We agreed as well to keep at least 20 minutes of our time at the end of each day when we have a project to debrief the work done during the day and set the goals for the next days.

The first tasks have been attributed as shown before.

### <u> Week feedback</u>

This week, we decided to focus on learning the C language, however, it's clear that we are behind in terms of management documents. We need to finish the creation of various documents and get the planning of most tasks done.

The overall team feeling is great, many members feel confident with the C language, and we are already thinking about how we will build our processor and thinking about the specification of our Assembly Language.

### <u>Next week planning </u>

Next week will be ruled by our progression in the C language.
Moreover, on Wednesday the 17th of January, we will meet in project time to brainstorm about the project. Discuss more deeply the specification of our Assembly language. And the architecture of our processor.

Next week's priorities are:

* Learning C language
* Project Charter
* Task allocation document
* Assembly syntax and rules
* Processor architecture
* Functional specifications
* RACII
* Gantt

### <u>Team meeting</u>

The 17th of January 2024, we gathered for the first during project time to have a meeting about various directions to take, during the morning we had:

* Discussed the specifications of our Assembly Language,
* Broke down the different steps to build our own Virtual Processor,
* Started working on the Processor's architecture by checking different architectures that already exist,
* Decided to take inspiration from different CPUs, RISK-V, ARM...
* Set up our coding environment and laws of development.

* We have decided to contact the client about the various decisions that we have taken and the client seemed interested in the directions we were taking.

### <u>Week feedback</u>

This week didn't mark any great advancement document writing-wise, but gathering to take all these decisions was necessary. We are sure to all have the same scope for the project. We still have yet to decide on all the specifications for the project, but this will be done shortly.

### <u>Next week planning</u>

* Initial meeting on Monday the 22nd
* Functional specification near finalization
* Functional specification review, if finished
* Project Charter publishing
* Advancing on Technical specifications (25% of completion)
* Advancing on Test plan (20% completion)
* Discuss the last details
* Beginning of vCPU development

### <u>Team meeting</u>

During the week, we had one meeting on Monday the 22nd of January, during this meeting, we discussed the last details to decide on concerning our assembly language.  
We've discussed the upcoming tasks and how we would dispatch them to the team.
Many technical decisions have been made amongst the team, which will be described in the functional and technical specifications.  
Moreover, we've discussed the various KPIs that would be set, here's a link to the KPIs: [Link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_e3KZmQ_rL7N9RfHELOPWwakPeHL5rIRIHAhU5QM1bc/edit#gid=704615476)  
On Friday the 26th, we made a meeting to debrief the whole week, we have determined the tasks that need to be done urgently for next week. Some members have to be working on the weekend to finalize the function specifications document. This means that a meeting is necessary on Monday the 29th to discuss the progress made on the document.

### <u>Week feedback</u>

This week marks huge progress document-wise, however, we didn't reach the expectations on the Functional Specifications document, meaning that we will have to work thoroughly on it on Monday and Tuesday.
Despite that, the team is content with the current state of the project, they like the way the team is managed, the ambiance is joyful and we are determined to keep on going on the project to handle a great product at the end of the project. Everything is going smoothly, even if we have to speed up on some tasks.

### <u>Next week planning </u>

* Finish the functional specification.
* Review the functional specification.
* Provide the document to the client.
* Keep on with the development of the processor.
* Keep on with the development of the assembly.
* Great progress concerning the technical specifications - Which needs to be nearly reviewable. (80% of completion)
* Progress concerning the Test Plan. (50% of completion)
* Meetings on Monday and Friday.

## Week 4

### <u>Introduction </u>

This week marks the fourth week of the Virtual Processor Project. One major event happened this week: we had to submit and send the [functional specifications](https://github.com/algosup/2023-2024-project-3-virtual-processor-team-3/blob/main/documents/functional_specifications.md) to the client. \
However, there was no time to rest as the technical specifications document is due next week. \
Moreover, we need to keep progressing on the overall state of the project. \
This document will show the weekly progress made on the project, on various tasks and shows the tasks done during the week.

### <u>Team meeting</u>

The first weekly meeting was held on Monday the 29th of January. \
Firstly, we discussed the various progress that were made during the weekend to plan the week according to what we needed to do. \
We agreed on focusing on the Functional Specifications as the document was due the next day and much work still needed, at the time, to be done on the document. \
Moreover, the team mentioned that the Project Manager was not enough integrated into the technical discussions, and this had to be taken into consideration. \
We then dispatched various tasks for the day and started to work. \

The second weekly meeting was held on Friday the second of February, we discussed the various tasks done during the week and congratulated each other for the progress made. \
We discussed some more technical ideas that we had throughout the week and decided to think about these during the weekend to make a great decision on Monday.
Moreover, Aurélien, Quentin and Thibaud decided to keep on working on the technical specifications to maintain the document at a great overall quality. \
The team feels great according to the feedback they gave, we have to keep working this way for the project's well-being. We discussed the progress made on different tasks to fuel the KPIs, so far, they are great, even if we still could do better. \
This wrapped up the week, we are ready for a new one.

### <u>Week feedback</u>

This week, we had 21 project hours available to us, Monday and Tuesday were ruled by finalizing the functional requirements document, its review, and its submission. The team was delighted to conclude this document, it was a relief. \
However, we noticed that the document still needed some changes, which were done, later. \
Moreover, the technical specifications document is done and awaiting review. The document will undergo many modifications still but most of the job is done. \
From the meetings we held and personal feedback, the team would like the Project Manager to be more of a part of the discussions that are held about the technical part of the project. In this dynamic of change, the [Communication Management Plan Document](https://github.com/algosup/2023-2024-project-3-virtual-processor-team-3/blob/main/documents/Management/weekly_report/weekly_report3.md) was created, to improve the communication from within the team but also reflect exterior sources. \
This week was exhaustive, the team needs to rest during the weekend. Our team will come back, energetic, on Monday.

### <u>Next week planning </u>

Next week, will mostly be overtime hours as we only have, three hours and thirty minutes in project time, all together. Meaning, it is necessary to work overtime next week, on the various tasks dispatched. \
For a more detailed breakdown, please refer to the Gant chart: [Link](https://github.com/orgs/algosup/projects/20/views/4)

* Finalize the Technical Specifications
* Review Technical Specifications document
* Submit the Technical Specifications
* Test Cases finalize
