### <u>Team meeting</u>

Our first team meeting was held on the 10th of January 2024.  
During this meeting, we agreed on holding at least two weekly meetings according to our project time. We agreed as well to keep at least 20 minutes of our time at the end of each day when we have a project to debrief the work done during the day and set the goals for the next days.

The first tasks have been attributed as shown before.

### <u> Week feedback</u>

This week, we decided to focus on learning the C language, however, it's clear that we are behind in terms of management documents. We need to finish the creation of various documents and get the planning of most tasks done.

The overall team feeling is great, many members feel confident with the C language, and we are already thinking about how we will build our processor and thinking about the specification of our Assembly Language.

### <u>Next week planning </u>

Next week will be ruled by our progression in the C language.
Moreover, on Wednesday the 17th of January, we will meet in project time to brainstorm about the project. Discuss more deeply the specification of our Assembly language. And the architecture of our processor.

Next week's priorities are:

* Learning C language
* Project Charter
* Task allocation document
* Assembly syntax and rules
* Processor architecture
* Functional specifications
* RACII
* Gantt

The 17th of January 2024, we gathered for the first during project time to have a meeting about various directions to take, during the morning we had:

* Discussed the specifications of our Assembly Language,
* Broke down the different steps to build our own Virtual Processor,
* Started working on the Processor's architecture by checking different architectures that already exist,
* Decided to take inspiration from different CPUs, RISK-V, ARM...
* Set up our coding environment and laws of development.

* We have decided to contact the client about the various decisions that we have taken and the client seemed interested in the directions we were taking.

### <u>Week feedback</u>

This week didn't mark any great advancement document writing-wise, but gathering to take all these decisions was necessary. We are sure to all have the same scope for the project. We still have yet to decide on all the specifications for the project, but this will be done shortly.

### <u>Next week planning </u>

* Initial meeting on Monday the 22nd
* Functional specification near finalization
* Functional specification review, if finished

### <u>Team meeting</u>

During the week, we had one meeting on Monday the 22nd of January, during this meeting, we discussed the last details to decide on concerning our assembly language.  
We've discussed the upcoming tasks and how we would dispatch them to the team.
Many technical decisions have been made amongst the team, which will be described in the functional and technical specifications.  
Moreover, we've discussed the various KPIs that would be set, here's a link to the KPIs: [Link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_e3KZmQ_rL7N9RfHELOPWwakPeHL5rIRIHAhU5QM1bc/edit#gid=704615476)  
On Friday the 26th, we made a meeting to debrief the whole week, we have determined the tasks that need to be done urgently for next week. Some members have to be working on the weekend to finalize the function specifications document. This means that a meeting is necessary on Monday the 29th to discuss the progress made on the document.

### <u>Week feedback</u>

This week marks huge progress document-wise, however, we didn't reach the expectations on the Functional Specifications document, meaning that we will have to work thoroughly on it on Monday and Tuesday.
Despite that, the team is content with the current state of the project, they like the way the team is managed, the ambiance is joyful and we are determined to keep on going on the project to handle a great product at the end of the project. Everything is going smoothly, even if we have to speed up on some tasks.

### <u>Next week planning </u>

* Finish the functional specification.
* Review the functional specification.
* Provide the document to the client.
* Keep on with the development of the processor.
* Keep on with the development of the assembly.
* Great progress concerning the technical specifications - Which needs to be nearly reviewable. (80% of completion)
* Progress concerning the Test Plan. (50% of completion)
* Meetings on Monday and Friday.

## Weekly Report N°4

### <u>Introduction </u>

This week marks the fourth week of the Virtual Processor Project. One major event happened this week: we had to submit and send the [functional specifications](https://github.com/algosup/2023-2024-project-3-virtual-processor-team-3/blob/main/documents/functional_specifications.md) to the client. \
However, there was no time to rest as the technical specifications document is due next week. \
Moreover, we need to keep progressing on the overall state of the project. \
This document will show the weekly progress made on the project, on various tasks, and shows the tasks done during the week.

### <u>Team meeting</u>

The first weekly meeting was held on Monday the 29th of January. \
Firstly, we discussed the various progress that were made during the weekend to plan the week according to what we needed to do. \
We agreed on focusing on the Functional Specifications as the document was due the next day and much work still needed, at the time, to be done on the document. \
Moreover, the team mentioned that the Project Manager was not enough integrated into the technical discussions, and this had to be taken into consideration. \
We then dispatched various tasks for the day and started to work. \

The second weekly meeting was held on Friday the second of February, we discussed the various tasks done during the week and congratulated each other for the progress made. \
We discussed some more technical ideas that we had throughout the week and decided to think about these during the weekend to make a great decision on Monday.
Moreover, Aurélien, Quentin, and Thibaud decided to keep on working on the technical specifications to maintain the document at a great overall quality. \
The team feels great according to the feedback they gave, we have to keep working this way for the project's well-being. We discussed the progress made on different tasks to fuel the KPIs, so far, they are great, even if we still could do better. \
This wrapped up the week, we are ready for a new one.

### <u>Week feedback</u>

This week, we had 21 project hours available to us, Monday and Tuesday were ruled by finalizing the functional requirements document, its review, and its submission. The team was delighted to conclude this document, it was a relief. \
However, we noticed that the document still needed some changes, which were done, later. \
Moreover, the technical specifications document is done and awaiting review. The document will undergo many modifications still but most of the job is done. \
From the meetings we held and personal feedback, the team would like the Project Manager to be more of a part of the discussions that are held about the technical part of the project. In this dynamic of change, the [Communication Management Plan Document](https://github.com/algosup/2023-2024-project-3-virtual-processor-team-3/blob/main/documents/Management/weekly_report/weekly_report3.md) was created, to improve the communication from within the team but also reflect exterior sources. \
This week was exhaustive, the team needs to rest during the weekend. Our team will come back, energetic, on Monday.

### <u>Next week planning </u>

Next week, will mostly be overtime hours as we only have, three hours and thirty minutes in project time, all together. Meaning, it is necessary to work overtime next week, on the various tasks dispatched. \
For a more detailed breakdown, please refer to the Gant chart: [Link](https://github.com/users/Biohazardyee/projects/2/views/2)

* Finalize the Technical Specifications
* Review the Technical Specifications document
* Submit the Technical Specifications
* Test Cases finalize
* Test plan nearly completed (75%)
* 60% completion for the Processor development

## Weekly Report N°5

### <u> Introduction </u>

This week marks the 5th week of the virtual processor project. However, this week was cut short as only 3h30 was specified during school hours for the week.
We've been focusing on another project that was given to us in Git class.

### <u>Team meeting</u>

The team gathered on Monday the 5th of January and was the only time in the week that they gathered to discuss the project's progress. We've only dispatched basic tasks. We knew that the week would be short project-wise. However, some progress needed to be made to improve the final product. So the week was made to read documentation for ourselves on how we would build the debugger. We're still needing to define all the major steps to create it. \
Moreover, we've received the functional specification feedback from the reviewers and analyzed it. We've found many points to modify and to go deeper into to improve the document and the final product's quality.

### <u>Week feedback</u>

As previously said, the week was quite short, our team was focused on the Git courses. Little to no progress was made on the product, but this week was necessary for the team and was resourceful. More progress will be made next week and hopefully, we will nearly finish the processor and the assembly. Then we will focus on the debugger and the Visual Studio code plugin.

### <u>Next week planning </u>

For a more detailed breakdown, please refer to the Gant chart: [Link](https://github.com/users/Biohazardyee/projects/2/views/2)

* Finalize the Test Plan
* Submit the Test plan to the client and the reviewers
* Start the debugger development

### <u>Team meeting</u>

The team first gathered on monday the 12th of january 2024, after briefly discussing the various progress made during the weekend, the team quickly got back to work on the various task that were dispatched. We agreed on starting to create the Assembly documentation during the week. Moreover, the development team started to implement various features.
On friday the 16th, no meeting was "held" as we had to release the Test Plan, however, during the afternoon, we still had small talks about the week and about the next few weeks.

### <u>Week feedback</u>

The team is positive about the progress on the project and we expect to be respect deadlines, however, we're finding out that some nice to have features we would have liked to add to our product will most likely be present in the final product, as we are starting to get low on available hours. Moreover, we will need to prepare the oral presentation which will occupy most of our time during the next weeks.
We will most likely check all the requirements, but we will most likely not being able to have a fully working products, nice to have wise.

### <u>Next week planning </u>

For a more detailed breakdown, please refer to the Gant chart: [Link](https://github.com/users/Biohazardyee/projects/2/views/2))

* Near the finalization of the processor and the assembly
* Try to have a small working debugger
* Start working on the oral presentation
* Quality check the whole product
* Finalize the assembly documentation

## Weekly Report N°7

### <u> Introduction </u>

This week, despite being the last week of the project is the last week of development for the Virtual Processor. Meaning that by the end of the week, we need to release our final product. This means that both our Assembler and Processor have to be finished, refurbished and to ensure that a user can use our product.

### <u>Team meeting</u>

The team gathered for the first time on Monday the 19th in the afternoon, we've discussed the progress made during the weekend and the last steps that will be taken during the last week of development, we decided to stop focusing on building a debugger to focus on a more reliable and convenient product.
Moreover, we decided not to do a meeting on Friday as the team was rushing to release the product as some non-ideal event occurred leading us to lose time (this will be detailed in the week's feedback).

### <u>Week feedback</u>

The week went smoothly. However, Mathis was sick for nearly the whole week and it has highly impacted the development of the assembler. However, after a meeting, he told us that he could ensure the release of the assembler on Friday. This wasn't ensured. We decided to take action and decided to create a backup assembler ( rushed one) on Thursday. Malo has done a wonderful job by providing such a great assembler in such a short time frame. We are still waiting for Mathis Assembler to be given to the team, to then implement it into the final product. It will be the next step of our product and will mark the first update. We expected to have it for Friday, however on Sunday. We still don't have any news from Mathis' assembler.

We are saddened to not being able to use a refurbished assembler by the time of the release of the product, but the worst has been managed and by now, we have a working product. It isn't as effective as planned but it's working.

### <u>Next week planning </u>

Next week will not have a huge impact project-wise as we will mainly focus on preparing for the final presentation of the project and the product.

Next week's tasks:

* Prepare the final oral exam
* Update the product with the right assembler instead of the back up one
* Discuss what went wrong with the team
* Enjoy our last week as a team!

## Weekly Report N°8

This weekly report marks the last one of the project as it is now wrapped up. This week helped us to finalize as much as possible the project. Our fina presentation was overall quite good, despite some mishap. That can be explain by a lack of rehearsal and knowledge about the hardware.

### <u>Team meeting</u>

Just like every week, we started off the week by doing a meeting on monday, which was made to recap what was done during the weekend. Moreover, we started discussing how we would be doing the oral presentation, that's when the idea of doing some theater-like presentation came to our mind. We decided to act as some sort of security team with Aurélien being the owner of a secret new technology. We thought that it was a bit over the top but the idea was great because we wanted to test the limits of the school in term of liberty we can take on creating the oral presentation. We wanted to push the limits and go out of our confort zone.

After a last meeting on friday, to debrief the oral presentation and to define the post-mortem document, we agreed on saying that we were happy of the final product we were able to present. Moreover, we are proud of our presentation, which didn't fully went as expected as we had some technical mishaps during the presentation but we finefully cope with them and ended having a great impact on the audience, but not so much on the jury, even if we feel like that the liked it.

### <u>Week feedback</u>

We are quite happy about we've been able to do during this week, we have finished various tasks and greatly improved the overall quality of the product and reached our goal to create an educative platform, which is simple and easy to use. We were able to create the syntax highlighting, create the snippets, put everything into a Visual Studio snippet and finaly add the final version of Mathis' assembler. We are proud of the progress made this far and of the product. \
We had a great time as a team, we are saddened to part ways for now, but will likely be able to work together and thus happily with each other for another project.

### <u>Next week planning </u>

Next week planning:

* Enjoy our vacations
* Get ready for the next project
* Keep using our product to try and find ways to improve it
* Start promoting the product
