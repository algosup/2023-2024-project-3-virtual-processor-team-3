# Project Virtual Processor - Team 3  

## Weekly Report N°8

This weekly report marks the last one of the project as it is now wrapped up. This week helped us to finalize as much as possible the project. Our fina presentation was overall quite good, despite some mishap. That can be explain by a lack of rehearsal and knowledge about the hardware.

### <u>Team meeting</u>

Just like every week, we started off the week by doing a meeting on monday, which was made to recap what was done during the weekend. Moreover, we started discussing how we would be doing the oral presentation, that's when the idea of doing some theater-like presentation came to our mind. We decided to act as some sort of security team with Aurélien being the owner of a secret new technology. We thought that it was a bit over the top but the idea was great because we wanted to test the limits of the school in term of liberty we can take on creating the oral presentation. We wanted to push the limits and go out of our confort zone.

After a last meeting on friday, to debrief the oral presentation and to define the post-mortem document, we agreed on saying that we were happy of the final product we were able to present. Moreover, we are proud of our presentation, which didn't fully went as expected as we had some technical mishaps during the presentation but we finefully cope with them and ended having a great impact on the audience, but not so much on the jury, even if we feel like that the liked it.

### <u>Week feedback</u>

We are quite happy about we've been able to do during this week, we have finished various tasks and greatly improved the overall quality of the product and reached our goal to create an educative platform, which is simple and easy to use. We were able to create the syntax highlighting, create the snippets, put everything into a Visual Studio snippet and finaly add the final version of Mathis' assembler. We are proud of the progress made this far and of the product. \
We had a great time as a team, we are saddened to part ways for now, but will likely be able to work together and thus happily with each other for another project.

### <u>Next week planning </u>

Next week planning:

- Enjoy our vacations
- Get ready for the next project
- Keep using our product to try and find ways to improve it
- Start promoting the product
