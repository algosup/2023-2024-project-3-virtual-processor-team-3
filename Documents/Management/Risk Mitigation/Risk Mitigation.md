## Risks and Mitigation

1. **Complexity:**
   - **Risk(s):** Designing a processor from scratch is a complex task, some features that we plan to implement might be hard and complex to be done.
   - **Mitigation:** Our team shouldn't rush into the development and ensures taht what we want to implement isn't out of scope. Moreover loads of researches have to be done around the project to understand in more deeper details how a processor is built and works.

2. **Resource management (inside our processor):**
   - **Risk(s):** Managing resources like memory (RAM, ROM), registers and cache can quite be a challenge. And thus can lead to performance issues, crashes, unexpected behaviors.
   - **Mitigation:** We have to thoroughly plan the architecture of our processor and make sure that everything works effectively, memory management has to be as efficient as possible. This will be handled during development process, checked by developers, then checked during quality assurance, to make sure that everything runs smoothly and as expected.

3. **Sudden Changes:**
    - **Risk(s):** Indeed, the client could change requirements at any time during the project. If the client wants to change anything, from the requirements, to a specific architecture, whatever that has been specified or not in the Call For Tender or anything succeeding it. 
    - **Mitigation:** We will comply to the client's expectation and requirements, so if needed after a change, we reserve ourselves the right to contact the client for any further information. Every consequences will be mitigated, changeing the Work Breakdown Structure, management strategies, development strategies and testing strategies, documents will be reworked to comply with the client's needs. Our team will do everything possible to overcome sudden changes.

4. **Meeting Project Requirements:**
    - **Risk(s):** Failing to meet the specified criteria will lead to the project's rejection and will be considered a failure. Leading to subsequent consequences.
    - **Mitigation:** Ensure that we fully understand the project its requirements and constraints, client's needs... Load of work has to be done before starting development and production of the product. We will contact the client if any areas are still mystified. In order to make sure that we will meet every requirements for this project and come up with a project that is what the client expected.

5. **Limited Hardware Knowledge:**
    - **Risk(s):** Not having the necessary hardware knowledge of the computer architecture and hardware design principles, would lead to not making the optimal design choices and our product might end up being flowfull.
    - **Mitigation:** Reading lots of documentations on already existing processor architecture like CISC, ARM, RISC and many others, to draw inspire and learn about the architecture of a processor and/or the computer's architecture. In order to have an efficient product in the end.

6. **Documentation and code maintenance**
    - **Risk(s):** Maintaining our hardware and software is crucial. If we have a poor documentation on our processor architecture and assembly language, ourselves and the user, might just get lost while using or maintaining the product, leading to an unstable and flowfull product.
    - **Mitigation:** Documentation will be done on our Processor architecture, our Assembly language, moreover these documents have to be as detailed and as clear as possible. Moreover, our developers will follow coding conventions that will be set and charted among us, so that the code is readable, maintainable and leading to a higher product quality, making it easier to implement new functionnality if needed, and making sure that everything is smooth and connected.

7. **Debugging and Testing:**
    - **Risk(s):** Debugging low level programming languages can become a challenge. Moreover, we have to come up with our own debugger built-in debugger. This task will be time consuming for the software engineers as well as for the quality assurance. Morevoer, we have to be sure that everything works as intended so testing everything will take lots of time to be done effectively.
    - **Mitigation:** Testing has to be done gradually, according to the project's development, starting to test early on is necessary to remove problems as early as possible. Flattening the exhaustion of the necessary work needed to be done here on a longer period of time is also necessary.

8. **Time Constraint:**
    - **Risk(s):** Learning the C language, the internal architecture of a CPU, defining all the tasks needing to be done, and then producting the final product is time consuming, some weeks of research, learning and set up will be needed for the well-being of the project, meaning that we are 'wasting' development time.
    - **Mitigation:** We have to start learning about various specificities as soon as possible and as efficiently as possible to not lose too much time. Moreover, task being dispatched evenly and not exhaustively is necessary for the well-being of both the team and the project.

9. **Loss Of Human Resources:**
    - **Risk(s):** Team members can fall under sickness to the point of not being able to work. Transportation can be challengeing for some team members coming by train which can be unavailable, leading to the unavailability to be present. These are such examples showing that it can be sometimes challengeing to be present and work in the most effective manner. Meaning that we could be losing hours of work if a team member is unavailable to work for a reason.
    - **Mitigation:** Tasks could be reatrributed to another team member if needed, so that we do not lose too much time and keep up to the pace that we desire.

Here are some of the various risks that our team might encounter during the project, however this document is not preventing every possible risks that might happen and isn't a hazard proof treshold, some events might still encounter.
