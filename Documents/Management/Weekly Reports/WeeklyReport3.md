# Project Virtual Processor - Team 3  

## Weekly Report N°3

### <u> Introduction </u>

Third week of the Virtual Processor project, for ALGOSUP. This week was ruled by great progress made on the project. The Functional Specification document is due next week so most of the work has to be done on the document, moreover, various other tasks have been done during the week, so let's deal with that.

### <u>Team meeting</u>

During the week, we had one meeting on Monday the 22nd of January, during this meeting, we discussed the last details to decide on concerning our assembly language.  
We've discussed the upcoming tasks and how we would dispatch them to the team.
Many technical decisions have been made amongst the team, which will be described in the functional and technical specifications.  
Moreover, we've discussed the various KPIs that would be set, here's a link to the KPIs: [Link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_e3KZmQ_rL7N9RfHELOPWwakPeHL5rIRIHAhU5QM1bc/edit#gid=704615476)

### <u>Week feedback</u>

### <u>Next week planning </u>

- Finish the functional specification.
- Review the functional specification.
- Provide the document to the client.
- Keep on with the development of the processor.
- Keep on with the development of the assembly.
- Great progress concerning the technical specifications - Which needs to be nearly reviewable. (80% of completion)
