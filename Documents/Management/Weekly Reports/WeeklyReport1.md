### <u>Team meeting</u>

Our first team meeting was held on the 10th of January 2024.  
During this meeting, we agreed on holding at least two weekly meetings according to our project time. We agreed as well to keep at least 20 minutes of our time at the end of each day when we have a project to debrief the work done during the day and set the goals for the next days.

The first tasks have been attributed as shown before.

### <u> Week feedback</u>

This week, we decided to focus on learning the C language, however, it's clear that we are behind in terms of management documents. We need to finish the creation of various documents and get the planning of most tasks done.

The overall team feeling is great, many members feel confident with the C language, and we are already thinking about how we will build our processor and thinking about the specification of our Assembly Language.

### <u>Next week planning </u>

Next week will be ruled by our progression in the C language.
Moreover, on Wednesday the 17th of January, we will meet in project time to brainstorm about the project. Discuss more deeply the specification of our Assembly language. And the architecture of our processor.

Next week's priorities are:

* Learning C language
* Project Charter
* Task allocation document
* Assembly syntax and rules
* Processor architecture
* Functional specifications
* RACII
* Gantt
