# 1. Introduction

This test plan is designed to prescribe the scope, approach, resources, and schedule of all testing activities for the project Virtual_Processor_Team_3.

This project has for objective to recreate a virtual processor and a corresponding assembly language with basic commands such as arithmetic operations, logical operations, etc.

## 1.1 Scope

### 1.1.1 In Scope

All the feature of the project defined in the [Functional Specification](../TechnicalSpecifications.md) are in need to be tested

[insert_table_of_features/Functional_Specification]

### 1.1.2 Out-Of-Scope

These feature are not to be tested as they are not included in the requirement specifications
- [insert_features_not_to_be_tested/Functional_Specification]
- ...

## 1.2 Quality Objective

### 1.2.1 Primary Objective

The primary objective is to ensure that the project in its entirety meets the full requirements defined in the functional specifications and fit metrics for each quality requierement.

Any changes, additions, or deletion to the requirements document, Functional Specification, or Technical Specification will be documented and tested at the highest level of quality allowed within the remaining time of the project and within the ability of the test team.

### 1.2.2 Secondary Objective

The secondary objective will be to identify and expose all issues and the associated risks, communicate all known issues to the project team and ensure that all these issues are addressed before release.

## 1.3 Roles & Responsibilities

### 1.3.1 Developer(-s)

The team member or members that undertake solution development activities. Responsible for:
1. Developing the solution
2. Conduct Unit testing

### 1.3.2 Tester(-s)
The team member or members that undertake testing, and quality management activities. Responsible for:
1. Writing the test plan
2. Monitoring and managing testing integrity
3. Support and conduct testing activities
4. Communicate to the project team on the current issues in the project

# 2 Test Methodology

## 2.1 Overview

For this project, we will follow an iterative testing strategy, as it will allow us to have testing feedback rapidely and on a regular basis (at each Milestone/Release). It will also allow us to save time on testing after multiple iterations based on experience from past iterations.

We will use usability testing to ensure complience with the user's needs and Unit testing to verify functionality and code coverage.

## 2.2 Usability Testing

The purpose of usability testing is to ensure that the new components and/or features will function in a proper manner that is acceptable to the user.

Usability testing can be coordinated by Tester(-s), but actual testing must be performed by non-testers (**as close to end-users as possible**). Tester(-s) will then review the findings and provide the project team with their evaluation of the impact these changes will have on the testing process and to the project as a whole.

We will use some help from other teams and enrole their QAs or Developers as our users for testing sessions. 

As we know those sessions are time consuming we will also propose that our QAs or Developer help other teams as users.

## 2.3 Unit testing (Multiple)

Unit testing will be conducted by the Developer during code development process to ensure that proper functionality and code coverage have been acheived.

Each function, whatever its porpuse, shall have at least one coresponding unit test that will verify its functionalty with multiple parameters to ensure flawless running of the solution.

## 2.4 Iteration Testing

Iterative development refers to the method which consist in dividing a project into smaller parts, when one is finish, we either iterate over it to enhanced it or implement it and pass to the next one.

The purpose of iterative testing is to complete iterative development by testing at the end of each "Iteration".

In our case, we will run test sessions at each merge in the main branch on the github repository.
