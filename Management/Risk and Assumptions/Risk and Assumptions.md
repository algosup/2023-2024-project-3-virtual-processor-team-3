## Risks and Mitigation

1. **Complexity:**
   - **Risk(s):** Designing a processor from scratch is a complex task, some features that we plan to implement might be hard and complex to be done.
   - **Mitigation:** Our team shouldn't rush into the development and ensures taht what we want to implement isn't out of scope. Moreover loads of researches have to be done around the project to understand in more deeper details how a processor is built and works.

2. **Resource management (inside our processor):**
   - **Risk(s):** Managing resources like memory (RAM, ROM), registers and cache can quite be a challenge. And thus can lead to performance issues, crashes, unexpected behaviors.
   - **Mitigation:** We have to thoroughly plan the architecture of our processor and make sure that everything works effectively, memory management has to be as efficient as possible. This will be handled during development process, checked by developers, then checked during quality assurance, to make sure that everything runs smoothly and as expected.

3. **Sudden Changes:**
    - **Risk(s):** Indeed, the client could change requirements at any time during the project. If the client wants to change anything, from the requirements, to a specific architecture, whatever that has been specified or not in the Call For Tender or anything succeeding it. 
    - **Mitigation:** We will comply to the client's expectation and requirements, so if needed after a change, we reserve ourselves the right to contact the client for any further information. Every consequences will be mitigated, changeing the Work Breakdown Structure, management strategies, development strategies and testing strategies, documents will be reworked to comply with the client's needs. Our team will do everything possible to overcome sudden changes.

4. **Meeting Project Requirements:**
    - **Risk(s):** Failing to meet the specified criteria will lead to the project's rejection and will be considered a failure. Leading to subsequent consequences.
    - **Mitigation:** Ensure that we fully understand the project its requirements and constraints, client's needs... Load of work has to be done before starting development and production of the product. We will contact the client if any areas are still mystified. In order to make sure that we will meet every requirements for this project and come up with a project that is what the client expected.

5. **Limited Hardware Knowledge:**
    - **Risk(s):** Not having the necessary hardware knowledge of the computer architecture and hardware design principles, would lead to not making the optimal design choices and our product might end up being flowfull.
    - **Mitigation:** Reading lots of documentations on already existing processor architecture like CISC, ARM, RISC and many others, to draw inspire and learn about the architecture of a processor and/or the computer's architecture. In order to have an efficient product in the end.


6. **Documentation and code maintenance**
    - **Risk(s):** Maintaining our hardware and software is crucial. If we have a poor documentation on our processor architecture and assembly language, ourselves and the user, might just get lost while using or maintaining the product, leading to an unstable and flowfull product.
    - **Mitigation:** Documentation will be done on our Processor architecture, our Assembly language, moreover these documents have to be as detailed and as clear as possible. Moreover, our developers will follow coding conventions that will be set and charted among us, so that the code is readable, maintainable and leading to a higher product quality, making it easier to implement new functionnality if needed, and making sure that everything is smooth and connected.
